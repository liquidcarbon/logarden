- Created GitHub repo for Logseq
	- Changed default branch to `main` while I'm at it
	- Now I'll create a new page called [[Setup]]
- Day 1 of the Glenwood Springs ♨️ trip
	- Lush green Betty Ford Gardens of Vail remind me of home
	- Glenwood Caverns is a cool amusement park on top of a mountain.  You get there on a gondola.  There are caves, rides, laser tag, and inexpensive food and snacks.
- Continuing with Logseq tutorials
	- Any block is treated as a page.  The block's child blocks become the top-level blocks of the page.
